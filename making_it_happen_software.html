<h3>
<a id="Software" class="anchor" href="#Software" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software</h3>
<p> 
The software discussed here does not exist. Even the most basic functions, such as understanding the meaning of natural language or what is happening in a scene captured though a computer’s cameras are only starting to achieve the most primitive rudiments of initial success. For decades, research attempts could manage not even that. 
<br><br>
That mismatch between the subject under discussion and the reality of today’s state of the art will be largely ignored. Since there is no known reason why software cannot advance to the level of processing language as well as any competent human can process, it will be assumed that eventually it will be achieved. The same goes for visual scene processing. 
<br><br>
Moreover, the goal of the current analysis is to determine how to actually close this gap between reality and the possible. Therefore, the gap itself cannot be a reason to dismiss the entire effort. 
<br><br>
What will be required at a minimum is software that can take a text of any length (say, a book) and be able to answer any questions an extremely intelligent and diligent human reader could answer about the text. Note, the choice of “be able to answer..” rather than phrases such as “understanding the text”. The same goes for “appreciating the text”, “being inspired by its content” or “the meaning of the words individually or the text as a whole”.  
<br><br>
Starting from the words and building up, the questions to be answered about any text, short or long, are those such as follows: 
<ul>
<li>Define this word in terms of other words </li>
<li>If shown a picture, label that picture with the correct word from the text </li>
<li>If shown a video of an action of even, label it with a word or phrase from the text </li>
<li>Find synonyms for any word in the text </li>
<li>Given any action or event in the text 
<ul>
<li>What made it occur? </li>
<li>Why was the action taken? </li>
<li>What are the direct and indirect consequences of such an action? </li>
<li>What are the motivations of a person taking the action? What does the person aim to achieve? </li>
<li>What seems to be the chronological sequence of the actions described? </li>
<li>What other actions or activities took place that the text did not see fit to mention (A was walking – A put one foot in front of the other. A did not fly. A stayed in the same state of dress throughout the action. A was not sleeping. A’s pulse may have gone up during the action but not inordinately. A did not go blind in the middle – it would have been mentioned. A did not start growing a tail in the middle. Gravity remained in effect throughout. Etc. etc. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the inter-phrase structure in any sentence or small group of sentences? Cause-effect, conditional, despite, chronological narration, lists etc. </li>
<li>What is the knowledge delivered or the argument being made by the author </li>
<li>What is the agenda of the author in a specific section of the text or the text as a whole </li>
<li>What is the plot, sub-plot etc? </li>
<li>Describe the personality and attributes of each character in the text. </li>
<li>What is the relationship between them? </li>
<li>Which actions are surprising, which are not and why? </li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul> 
If a computer program can accomplish every single item in the list (including the last), this discussion can skip over “understanding”, “meaning”, “appreciate” etc. (Lots of etc.’s here.) That is not to say that these terms are not challenging enough in themselves. It is just to say that progress can be made with the rest of the tasks laid out here without grappling with these terms.  
<br><br>
It is only for software that can make some progress with the items in this list, even if not all, that one can start talking about its morality. </p>
